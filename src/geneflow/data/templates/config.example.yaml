##### Inputs and Parameters #####
###############################################################################

# Each app input and parameter item is defined in a subsection with the same
# name as the input/parameter, and each subsection must have the following
# fields:
#
# 1. label: Short description of the field
# 2. description: Long description of the field
# 3. type: Data type of the field. For input fields, values can be: File, 
#    Directory, or Any. For parameter fields, values can be: File, Directory,
#    Any, string, int, float, double, or long.
# 4. required: Specifies if the input/parameter is required. 
# 5. default: Specifies the default value of the field. 
#
#    *Note: The following rules apply when handling "required" and "default"
#    fields: 
#    1. If required == true, default value is ignored
#    2. If required == false, and default is specified, the input/parameter is
#       set to the default value in the wrapper script before arg parsing and
#       allowed to be over-written by any args passed to the wrapper script. 
#    3. If required == false, and default is NOT specified, the input/parameter
#       is only set if corresponding args are passed to the wrapper script.
#
# 6. script_default: Only for inputs. Specifies the default value of the field
#    in the wrapper script and is over-written by the resolved "default" value. 
#
#    Note: The following rules apply when handling 'required' and
#    'script_default' fields:
#
#    1. If required == true, script_default value is ignored.
#    2. If required == false, and script_default is specified, the input is set
#       to the default value in the wrapper script before arg parsing and
#       allowed to be over-written by any args passed to the wrapper script.
#    3. If required == false, and script_default is NOT specified, the input is
#       only set if corresponding args are passed to the wrapper script.
#
# 7. test_value: (Optional) If specified, used as the value for this input/
#    parameter when generating the test script. 
# 8. post_exec: (Optional) List of shell/bash commands used for post processing
#    of the input/parameter value after argument parsing. Use these commands to
#    modify or check the value of inputs/parameters; or create additional
#    shell/bash variables for use in later parts of the script. By default, the
#    following commands are included in the wrapper script before any items
#    listed in post_exec. If the name of the input/parameter is "varname", then
#    the following lines are added to the wrapper script:
#
#    VARNAME_FULL=$(readlink -f ${VARNAME})
#    VARNAME_DIR=$(dirname ${VARNAME_FULL})
#    VARNAME_BASE=$(basename ${VARNAME_FULL})
#
#    See the section "Execution Blocks" for information about the required
#    format for execution blocks.

##### App Assets #####
###############################################################################

# App assets are additional scripts, binaries, or containers that need to be 
# cloned from a git repo, copied from another location, and/or built during app
# installation. 
#
# The app assets section should have the following format:
#
# 1. The assets section can have multiple sub-sections, with no strict naming
#    convention. Each section encompasses a single app asset.
# 2. Each section contains an array.
# 3. Each array element must have the following fields:
#    a. type: value can be "copy" or "build".
#    b. src: Source of assets. If type == copy, it must be relative to "prefix"
#       passed to the install script. If type == build, it must be relative to
#       the base app package directory and "build" must be the first folder
#       name. src can include wild-cards, e.g., /folder/*, but if wildcards are
#       specified, zip must be disabled.
#    c. dst - Destination of assets. This is relative to the base app package 
#       directory, and "assets" must be the first folder name.
#    d. zip - if present, src files are tar.gz zipped prior to copying to
#       destination. src must be a folder without wildcards if zipping. 
#    e. repo - if type == build, repo specifies the source repository to be
#       cloned into the "build" directory.
#    f. tag - if repo is specified and type == build, tag is the branch or tag
#       to be cloned.
#    g. folder - folder to which repo should be cloned. If "repo" is omitted,
#       "folder" must be present. If so, "folder" refers to a folder inside the 
#       app "build" directory that contains build scripts. "folder" is useful
#       when build scripts need to be included as part of the app package
#       (instead of in a separate repo).
#
# "build" type assets, whether cloned from a git repo, or included as part of 
# the app package must include a "Makefile" with build instructions.

# Default asset to install if none is specified.

### Execution Blocks ###
#
# Execution blocks occur in input/parameter post processing sections (i.e.,
# post_exec), as well as app pre (i.e., pre_exec), post (i.e., post_exec), and
# method-specific (i.e., exec_methods.exec) execution sections. Regardless of
# the location, all execution blocks are similarly formatted. Each of these
# sections is an array, with each array item defined with the following fields:
#
# 1. if: (Optional) Condition that must be satisfied for the item to be
#    executed. See the section "Conditional Blocks" for more information.
# 2. pipe: (Optional) If included, all remaining fields at this level are 
#    ignored. The pipe field is an array, with each array item containing an 
#    execution item. The order of execution items within "pipe" are piped in 
#    order of appearance. STDOUT is piped from one execution command to the
#    next. Thus, within pipe execution items, the "stdout" field is ignored. 
#    Nested "pipe" fields are also ignored, preventing recursive piping. 
# 3. type: (Optional) Valid values are 'shell', 'singularity', and 'docker'. If
#    omiitted, the default value is 'shell'. This specifies the type of
#    execution.
# 4. run: Command to run. If type is singularity or docker, this is the command
#    passed to the container executor after the container image is specified.
# 5. image: If type is singularity or docker, this is the path, url , or name
#    of the container.
# 6. args: Optional arguments to be passed to the command. This is expected to
#    be an array, which each array item defined as follows:
#    1. flag: (Optional) If present, the argument is pre-pended with this
#       string.
#    2. mount: (Optional) If present, and type is singularity or docker, the
#       value should be the bash variable name representing one of the inputs
#       or file/directory parameters. For example, an input of "filename"
#       should be represented as "${FILENAME}". The file or directory's
#       containing directory is mounted to the container using the option:
#       "${FILENAME_DIR}:/dataX". If "value" is not specified, a value of 
#       "/dataX/${FILENAME_BASE}" is passed as an argument to the image. If
#       "value" is present, the value passed as an argument as follows:
#       "/dataX/[value]"
#    3. value: (Optional) If present, used as the argument value. If "mount" is
#       also present, see above rules for "mount".
#    Note that all "args" values are optional, and if none are specified, the
#    argument is ignored.
# 7. stdout: (Optional) If present, the command's standard output will be piped
#    here.
# 8. stderr: (Optional) If present, the command's standard error will be piped
#    here.
#
# All bash/shell commands in the "exec_methods" section has access to a number
# of pre-defined variables, including:
#
#    ${SINGULARITY}: set to "yes" or "no" depending on whether the
#       "singularity" binary was detected.
#    ${DOCKER}: set to "yes" or "no" depending on whether the "docker" binary
#       was detected.
#    ${SCRIPT_DIR}: directory of the wrapper script, which may not be the 
#       current directory. This depends on the execution environment.
#    ${VARNAME}: One for each input/parameter, set to value of the input/
#       parameter.
#    ${VARNAME_FULL}: if input/parameter is a file or directory, this is the 
#       full path of the input/parameter. 
#    ${VARNAME_DIR}: if input/parameter is a file or directory, this is the 
#       parent directory of the input/parameter.
#    ${VARNAME_BASE}: if input/parameter is a file or directory, this is the
#       basename of the input/parameter.
#    *Any additional bash/shell variables defined in the "post" section of each
#    input/parameter, or defined in the "pre_exec" section are also available.
#
#
### Conditional Blocks ###
#
# Nestable condition blocks. Test conditions can be grouped with the following
# section keywords, which must be list items:
#
# 1. all: All items in this section must be satisified (i.e., [a AND b .. ]).
# 2. any: At least one item in this section must be satisfied
#    (i.e., [a OR b .. ]).
# 3. none: None of the items in this section must be satisified
#    (i.e., NOT [a AND b ..]).
#
# These can be nested to any depth. Within these groups, test conditions can
# include the following, and parameters are passed as values (if single
# operand), or arrays (if two operands). Shell equivalent tests are shown
# below:
#
# 1. defined:           -n value
# 2. not_defined:       -z value
# 3. str_equal:         value[0] = value[1]
# 4. not_str_equal:     value[0] != value[1]
# 5. equal:             value[0] -eq value[1]
# 6. not_equal:         value[0] -ne value[1]
# 7. less:              value[0] -lt value[1]
# 8. greater:           value[0] -gt value[1]
# 9. less_equal:        value[0] -le value[1]
# 10. greater_equal:    value[0] -ge value[1]
# 11. file_exist:       -f value
# 12. not_file_exist:   ! -f value
# 13. dir_exist:        -d value
# 14. not_dir_exist:    ! -d value
# 15. exist:            -e value
# 16. not_exist:        ! -e value
# 17. in_path:          command -v value >/dev/null 2>&1
#
# All test conditions and section keywords must be list items. For example:
#
# if:
# - all:
#   - defined: '${VALUE}'
#   - str_equal: ['${VALUE}', 'val']
#
